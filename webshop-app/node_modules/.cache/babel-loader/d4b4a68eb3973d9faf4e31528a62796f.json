Privacy regulations outline the best practice principles, which set the minimum standards for how private sector businesses should handle Your personal information.\n<br/><br/>\nThe <strong>RoundStuff</strong> Privacy Policy has been prepared for You as part of our commitment to maintaining excellent customer service and provides You with important information on Your privacy rights.\n<br/><br/>\nIn accordance with applicable regulations, including without limitation the UK Data Protection Act 2018, the EU GDPR and other applicable data protection legislation, <strong>RoundStuff</strong> undertakes to comply with a number of important principles regarding the privacy and disclosure of this information.\n<br/><br/>\nAny questions about this Policy or more generally about <strong>RoundStuff</strong>’ use of personal data should be directed to the Privacy Officer via email at servicemanager@<strong>RoundStuff</strong>.com.\n<br/><br/>\nWe may need to update this Policy at any time and without notice and where we do this, we will ensure that such changes are appropriately published.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<strong>1. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong><br/>\nPersonal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). We may collect, use, store and transfer different categories of personal data about you through your interactions with us as follows:\n<br/><br/>\n• Name;\n<br/><br/>\n• Contact information including telephone/mobile and email address;\n<br/><br/>\n• Details of any conversations you may have with our customer services team (telephone or email);\n<br/><br/>\n• Details about transactions you have made including any details you have provided in respect of an order, the payments to and from you along with other details of products and services you have purchased from us; and\n<br/><br/>\n• Marketing and Communications data including your preferences in receiving marketing from us and your communication preference.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\nWe may also collect personal data about you from:\n<br/><br/>\n• cookies on our website. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details.\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>2. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong><br/>\nWe will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:\n<br/><br/>\n• Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you – unless you are resident in Hong Kong this will require an international transfer of data for which your consent is necessary\n<br/><br/>\n• Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.\n<br/><br/>\n• Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.\n<br/><br/>\n• For processing your personal data in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by notifying us.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<strong>RoundStuff</strong> will not sell, distribute or lease personal data we hold to third parties, unless required to fulfil its contractual obligations with a customer or as required by law. Where <strong>RoundStuff</strong> does have to seek permission, we will name the relevant third party and any such permission shall be limited to that third party.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<strong>3. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong><br/>\nWhen we use your personal data, the legal basis on which we rely to do so is as follows:\n<br/><br/>\nPurpose/Type of Activity\tLawful basis for processing<br/>\nAccount administration and relationship management\tPerformance of a contract with you and consent to international transfer<br/>\nInternal record keeping (e.g., fulfilling orders you place)\tPerformance of a contract with you and consent to international transfer<br/>\nDevelopment and improvements of services\tLegitimate interests<br/>\nInternal management and management reporting\tLegitimate interests<br/>\nImprovements to our website\tLegitimate interests<br/>\nDirect marketing – current customers and potential via mail and telephone, or electronic marketing\tConsent<br/>\nMarket Research\tLegitimate interests<br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\n<strong>4. SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES; INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong><br/>\nWhenever we transfer your personal data internationally, where required by law we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to your personal data by ensuring at least one of the relevant mandated safeguards are implemented. In the case of transfers from the UK or EEA: (i) we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the relevant authority; (ii) in the manner allowed by the relevant law, including Your consent; or (iii) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the relevant authorities for such purposes (“Standard Contractual Clauses” or “Model Contracts”).\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>RoundStuff</strong> may also occasionally be required, either by law, government departments, agencies and regulators to collect, use and share certain types of personal data to comply with requirements and regulations. For the purposes as set out above, <strong>RoundStuff</strong> may also allow third parties to process personal data on behalf of <strong>RoundStuff</strong> to support our administration. Some third parties with whom we may need to share data may be based outside Yours jurisdiction, so their processing of your personal data may also involve an international transfer of such data.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<strong>5. SECURITY</strong><br/>\n<strong>RoundStuff</strong> will hold Personal Information securely. Holding data securely is very important to us and we maintain physical, electronic and managerial procedures to keep safe all collated data secure. Only authorised employees and agents, contractors and sub-contractors, who provide data processing services for <strong>RoundStuff</strong>, are permitted access to the data. These individuals will only be allowed access to such data for the purposes identified within this Policy or for IT security and maintenance.\n<br/><br/>\nWhere a third party is processing such data, <strong>RoundStuff</strong> will take steps to ensure that such third party provide commitments to ensure that the data processed is in accordance with applicable law. If a third party is processing such data and is located in a country which does not have data protection laws which require the necessary standards, we will always take appropriate additional steps to ensure that personal data is kept safe and secure by those processing such data on Our behalf.\n<br/><br/>\nWe may use personal data to verify an individual’s identity to help prevent or detect fraud. These checks may involve information being disclosed to credit reference agencies, who may keep a record of that information. This is not a credit check and the customer’s credit rating will be unaffected.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<strong>6. RETENTION PERIOD</strong><br/>\nWe will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\n<br/><br/>\nIn some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<strong>7.YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong><br/>\nUnder certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You may have the right to:\n<br/><br/>\n• Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n<br/><br/>\n• Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n<br/><br/>\n• Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n<br/><br/>\n• Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n<br/><br/>\n• Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n<br/><br/>\n• Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n<br/><br/>\n• Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\n<br/><br/>\nIf you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact the Data Privacy Officer as set out in the Introduction.\n<br/><br/>\nIn the event you feel that <strong>RoundStuff</strong> has not held your personal information in an appropriate way, you may complain. We will endeavour to resolve any complaints received by the Privacy Officer promptly following receipt. We will keep in contact with you to ensure that you are kept informed of the progress and resolution of the investigation of your complaint. If you are not satisfied with the way in which your complaint has been dealt with, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your relevant data supervisory authority.\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\n\nCookie Policy for <strong>RoundStuff</strong><br/>\nWhat Are Cookies<br/>\nAs is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to Your computer, to improve Your experience.
